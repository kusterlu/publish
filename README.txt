This repository displays my two main research projects:

1) My B.Sc. thesis conducted at the Technical University Berlin (TUB) called "Predicting personality traits 
from touchscreen interactions" was later published  as a peer-reviewed publication on the QoMEX 2018 conference.
The respective folder contains the concise paper plus all R code used for the machine-learning models.

2) My M.Sc. research project at the London School of Economics (LSE) investigated how the use of 
self-tracking apps influences their users' Sense of Agency. The project combined first, the development 
of a brief yet valid scale for an experience-sampling paradigm. It second, required a week of intensive data collection 
- asking 35 participants a number of questions three times a day. Third, a multilevel-modelling paradigm
derived from econometrics was applied to disect participants' sentiments from the events in their life. 

The M.Sc. thesis was honored as best dissertation of the Master-programme, and received the LSE's Rob-Farr award.
In the respective folder you will find the R-code for the data-pipeline and analysis, as well as the M.Sc. thesis.
