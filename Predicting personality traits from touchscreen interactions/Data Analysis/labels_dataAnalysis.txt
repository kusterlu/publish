-- ProcessStudieGiorgio.R -- 
load the two aggregated features set (studie1 and studie2)
divide the 'count' variables by the session length.
unify columns names, columns and variable-types between the 
two data sets. 
output: data_aggregated.csv --> contain both data sets.

-- DataAnalysis.R --
throw out conditions that are not 'normal' scenario.
dimensionality reduction with 0.8
interpolation of missing values in Big5 with means.
several handy loops for inspecting the data.

-- runAll.R --
the classification. 
i found it very cumbersome in R to write functions which take
columns of data-frames as agruments. It is therefore much easier
to user the "search" toolbar on the upper side of the code-window,
type "extra" and in the replace window e.g. "neuro".
Once the code is written for one dimension it can be copy-and-pasted
this way within few seconds. 
the example works with extraversion.
- code sets up table which neatly reports confidence intervals,
significance, etc for all classifiers.
- target class is made.
set.seed operators make sure results are compareable cross classifiers. 

-- big5 visual --
number of plots for the dimensions.
